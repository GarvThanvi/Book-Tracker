# Book-Tracker
I've created a book tracking website using ExpressJS, NodeJS and PostgreSQL for database. Users can search for books using the Open Library API, add them to their "YourReads" or "Wishlist" .

User can search for books by using keywords or the title of the book. The book titles and covers are fetched using Open Library API.
